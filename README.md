# GrassrootLearn — Full Project (React + Vite)

This is the full project bundle for the GrassrootLearn website (React + Vite).
No uploaded image found. Created empty placeholder at public/assets/founder.jpg — replace this with your photo.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes
- If you provided a photo it has been added to `public/assets/founder.jpg`.
- If that file is empty or missing, replace it with your actual photo (named `founder.jpg`).
